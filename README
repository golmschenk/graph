For project 1 and 2, I have created a simple command user interface to interact with.
To run this, simply run the main.py file (Python 3 required).

You will be able to both manually create graphs via the prompt or have the option
to load them from a file. The program will then allow you to pick if you want to
see whether or not there are cycles, getting the shortest paths via Dijkstra's
algorithm, or find the reliability of the graph using backtracking. The reliability
also allows for multiple terminal vertices (as is an option for extra credit).

Project 3 on the website appeared not to be for this class, but I just did it quickly
anyway. To run this program, run the average_case.py file.

Note: I wasn't entirely sure how you wanted 2D wireless mesh graphs to be generated.
I simply made my program accept a file containing 2D coordinates. This creates the
vertices along with all the edges with the weight of each edge being the distance
between the points and the reliability of each edge being inversely proportional
to the distance.
